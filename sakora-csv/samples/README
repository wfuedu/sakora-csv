CSV Samples:
These samples are here to allow for better developer testing
(and to provide some decent samples for anyone looking to implement their own CSV feeds)

single    - very simple feeds which load just enough data to confirm that things are working (a tiny subset of multiple)
multiple  - complex feeds which load multiple terms worth of data and lots of users
partial   - a subset/variation on the 'multiple' feeds which can be used to test removals processing (missing spring term and some memberships have changed)

Recommended testing plan:
Clear the CM/Sakora database tables (using the script) and restart Sakai
Load the single feed (using load.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 10 lines with 0 errors: 7 adds, 3 updates, 0 deletes
Load the single feed again (using load.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 10 lines with 0 errors: 0 adds, 10 updates, 0 deletes

Clear the CM/Sakora database tables (using the script) and restart Sakai
Load the multiple feed (using load.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 186 lines with 0 errors: 41 adds, 145 updates, 0 deletes
Load the multiple feed again (using load.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 186 lines with 0 errors: 0 adds, 160 updates, 0 deletes
Load the partial feed (using load.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 119 lines with 0 errors: 0 adds, 93 updates, 60 deletes
Load the partial feed again (using load.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 119 lines with 0 errors: 0 adds, 93 updates, 60 deletes

Clear the CM/Sakora database tables (using the script) and restart Sakai
Load the multiple feed (using load.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 186 lines with 0 errors: 41 adds, 119 updates, 0 deletes
Load the partial feed (using load-ims.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 119 lines with 0 errors: 0 adds, 93 updates, 8 deletes
Load the partial feed again (using load-ims.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 119 lines with 0 errors: 0 adds, 93 updates, 8 deletes

Clear the CM/Sakora database tables (using the script) and restart Sakai
Load the multiple feed (using load.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 186 lines with 0 errors: 41 adds, 119 updates, 0 deletes
Load the partial feed (using load-imr.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 119 lines with 0 errors: 0 adds, 93 updates, 0 deletes
Load the partial feed again (using load-imr.sh)
Check the logs for ERROR/WARN (should find none) - expect 119 lines with 0 errors: 0 adds, 93 updates, 0 deletes

NOTE: the updates and deletes counts might vary based on whether you already 
      have the users loaded from previous runs, recommend you set the 
      net.unicon.sakora.csv.userRemovalMode=ignore unless actively testing user processing


SQL cleanup script:
There is also a cleanup sql script which is for testing purposes only and will clean out all the CM tables
(effectively resetting the system to the state it was in before any feeds were processed).
